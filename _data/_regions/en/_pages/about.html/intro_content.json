With such glamourous and unique design features, this full service luxury property truly delivers. Relax and soak up the sun at our Oasis Garden Pool&nbsp;while enjoying something from our exceptional food and beverage selection. Surrounded by a vibrant city and calming ocean vistas, the Celino is a seamless merger of historic Art Deco retrofit with a modern beachfront expansion. Offering a calm residential vibe, our boutique hotel blends tropical surroundings with modern d&eacute;cor and playful touches. Hey, the conga line was invented here after all. And yes, we can supply Conga drums....upon request of course.</p>\n<p>The Celino provides guests with a full selection of hotel services and amenities. From our courtyard bar, in-room dining, fitness center to our concierge services, we'll make certain you have everything you need during your stay in Miami.</p>",
