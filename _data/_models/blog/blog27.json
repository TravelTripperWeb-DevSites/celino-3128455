  "more_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">In Miami, seasons change with little fanfare. Famous for year-round sunny and warm weather, our city still puts on an autumnal show with lots of seasonal activities and fall fun. Between holidays, food festivals, and cultural celebrations, we&rsquo;ve got you covered with things to do in Miami this fall.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Miami Entertainment Months</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Enjoy two months of savings during Miami Entertainment Months. Now through the end of November, visitors can save at select venues around the city. Visit <a href=\"https://www.miamiandbeaches.com/offers/temptations/miami-entertainment-months\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greater Miami and the Beaches</a> for a full list of places offering sweet savings, including 15% off Miami City Ballet ticket prices, BOGO tickets to see the South Beach Chamber Ensemble, and discounts at craft breweries, restaurants, and concert halls.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Hispanic Heritage Month</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Celebrate the histories, cultures, and contributions of Hispanic Americans during National Hispanic Heritage Month in Miami. <a href=\"https://www.celebrateorgullo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Orgullo</a> highlights the local Hispanic LGBTQ community with 15 days of cultural events in Miami Beach, the annual La Gran Fiesta is a day of music, dancing, and artistry, and the Coral Gables Hispanic Cultural Festival features local musicians, folkloric performers, artists, and designers in a weekend long family-friendly event.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Pumpkin Patches</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Get in the fall spirit with a visit to a local pumpkin patch. The Pumpkin Patch on SW 104th St is a great place to select the perfect gourds for carving or creating tasty recipes. For a farmers fall fest experience, head north to <a href=\"https://flamingoroadnursery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flamingo Road Nursery</a> in Davie. Each year from the end of September to the first week of November, the nursery presents their annual Fall Festival. The tropical nursery gets a makeover with cornstalks, hay bales, fall mums, pumpkins, scarecrows, kids crafts, and live music.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Oktoberfests</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Oktoberfest celebrations abound in Miami beginning in late September. Wynwood&rsquo;s Octoberfest, Wharftoberfest in Brickell, and Grovetoberfest in Regatta Park (the largest craft beer festival in Florida!) all have German bites, brews, and live music. For a more traditional festival honoring German culture, visit the <a href=\"http://gascmiami.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">German American Social Club</a>. The GASC has been organizing their annual Oktoberfest party since 1958, hosting two weekends of Bavarian food, beer, games, music, traditional folk dancing, and kids activities.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Food Festivals</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fall food fests may bring apple cider and pumpkin spice to mind, but Miami has so much more to offer. The city hosts back-to-back seafood fests (South Florida Seafood Festival and <a href=\"https://sobeseafoodfest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">South Beach Seafood Week</a>) to kick off stone crab season. Vegan food festivals Seed Food and Wine Week and Wynwood&rsquo;s Vegan Block Party celebrate all things plant-based, and PeruFest and the Creole Food Festival in Little Haiti bring the spice.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Live Music</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">American Airlines Arena and The Fillmore Miami Beach at Jackie Gleason Theater always host worldwide tours from music&rsquo;s mega stars. For smaller performances, check out the North Beach Bandshell or the Museum of Contemporary Art for their free outdoor Friday jazz series. The music never stops in Miami. While other music festivals around the country are wrapping up, Miami is just getting started. <a href=\"http://rakastella.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rakastella</a> takes over Virginia Key Beach Park for a day of dance music with an all-star DJ lineup and <a href=\"https://wynwoodfactory.com/events/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Heart Festival</a> throws an epic two-day, four-stage dance concert in the Wynwood Factory.</p>\n<h4>Halloween</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We&rsquo;ve rounded up all the haunted happenings in Miami.

Board the Venetian Lady luxury charter yacht for a cruise around Biscayne Bay and a traditional Thanksgiving buffet-style feast. Book a table at a local restaurant. Boulud Sud, The Dutch, Lure Fishbar, and Upland Miami all put on a splendid holiday spread. Michelin-starred Japanese restaurant Azabu and the Italian eatery Sette Osteria will be open for dinner as well, serving up Thanksgiving-inspired world cuisine.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Art Basel</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Miami Beach event of the year takes over the Miami Beach Convention Center every December for three days of modern and contemporary art from more than 200 leading galleries and 4,000 artists. <a href=\"https://www.artbasel.com/miami-beach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Art Basel</a> (pictured above) brings the world&rsquo;s top curators, museums, and collectors to town for a weekend of parties, celebrities, satellite fairs, and major artsy events.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Visiting Miami in the fall?
