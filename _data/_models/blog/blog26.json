From haunted houses to spooktacular parties, we&rsquo;ve narrowed Miami&rsquo;s Halloween events down to the best of the best (with a mix of both adults-only and kid-friendly events). Embrace the season&rsquo;s spooky spirit with these annual Halloween festivities.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">1. Halloween on Lincoln Road</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thousands of costume-clad visitors take over the iconic pedestrian mall for a night of mingling, trick-or-treating, and bar-hopping. Wear your best costume to the family-friendly Halloween night event beginning at 5 p.m.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">2. HalloWYN Block Party</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wynwood&rsquo;s massive Halloween block party returns for an epic night of free activities, a costume contest, and over 20 food trucks at Wynwood Marketplace. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hallowyn-2019-wynwood-halloween-block-party-tickets-62675118968\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HalloWYN</a> will feature a Fire Bar where A-list bartenders will be slinging cocktails and a Dragon&rsquo;s Den with LED activations, fire spinners, and a marketplace with vendors and DJs.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">3. Bar Crawls</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Take your pick of spooky bar crawls through Downtown. SHOTS Miami in Wynwood hosts the annual Fright Night Bar Crawl while Brickell presents the Monster Bar Crawl. Monster Bar Crawl begins at Blackbird Ordinary and welcomes 1,000 costumed crawlers for a night of drinking, dancing, and hijinks at five participating bars. Both crawls are happening on October 26 and 31.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">4. Halloween Yacht Party</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All aboard the South Beach Lady for Miami&rsquo;s sexiest Halloween party.

Enjoy four levels of cabana lounges, multiple bars, and a complimentary light buffet during this costume-mandatory party on October 26.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">5. Something&rsquo;s Brewing After Dark&nbsp;</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 21+ party at Miami Children&rsquo;s Museum will feature a costume contest, open bar, local brews, and tasty treats provided by top Miami restaurants. Brave their haunted house and dance the night away while your ticket price directly supports the museum&rsquo;s educational programs. The all-inclusive party takes place on October 25 from 9:30 p.m. - 1:30 a.m.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">6. Wynwood Fear Factory</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">South Florida&rsquo;s biggest Halloween electronic dance music experience is back on October 25 at Mana Wynwood Convention Center. What&rsquo;s been described as a mash-up between Ultra and Halloween Horror Nights, the horror fest will feature live talent from Illenium, Knife Party, Malaa, EDX, and more international top DJs. If you can&rsquo;t make it to Wynwood Fear Factory, Miami&rsquo;s hottest clubs are throwing their own Halloween dance parties. Space will have a Halloween night bash with DJs Damian Lazarus, Blond:ish, and Monolink and E11even will host an over the top Ghost Town Halloween event featuring Swedish electro-house DJ duo Dada Life.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">7. Zoo Boo at Zoo Miami</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bring the kids to Zoo Miami for an evening of trick-or-treating, games, and events at the annual Zoo Boo. Participate in the Fang-tastic costume contest, make Halloween crafts, and watch the animals get their Halloween goodies. Zoo Boo is included in the price of admission on October 26 - 27.</p>\n<h4>8. Nightmare on the Beach</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Little Lighthouse Foundation&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://nightmareonthebeach.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10th annual party</a> will have an open bar, great food, and live entertainment.&nbsp;The party on the beach&nbsp;will be held at Lummus Park, only steps from Celino Hotel.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">9. Haunted Houses</h4>\n<p>Traverse House of Death&rsquo;s 15,000 square-foot haunted house with scary characters and spooky passageways. Once you make it through, relax in the lounge area with food trucks, drinks, and DJs. House of Death runs from October 4 - November 2 at 1700 NE 2nd Ave. in Miami Shores. Don&rsquo;t wait until Halloween to get scared. Wynwood&rsquo;s Paranoia Horror Maze is open year-round. Test your limits of fear in the black out horror maze but beware, this experience is not for the faint of heart.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">10. Monster Splash at Miami Seaquarium</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The popular Monster Splash returns to Miami Seaquarium for themed shows, rides, Flipper&rsquo;s dance party, and trick-or-treating around the park.
