  "more_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">In a city with year-round warm weather, white sand beaches, and vibrant culture, having a good time comes with the territory. Miami is rife with bars and cantinas. Instead of another trip to the first bar you see, try these off-beat options. Here are a few of our favorite out-there spots to imbibe.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Bodega Taqueria y Tequila</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There&rsquo;s more than meets the eye at this tricked out taco truck. The Airstream trailer within the restaurant serves up tasty tacos and Happy Hour deals, but take the secret door to the speakeasy cocktail lounge. The space is filled with sexy people, killer craft cocktails, velvet couches, and DJs spinning dance beats. <em>1220 16th St, Miami Beach</em></p>\n<h4>The Forge Wine Bar</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://theforge.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Forge</a> gives us all the luxury Renaissance feels. With a trendy atmosphere, medieval dining room, purple lighting, and bling, this upscale wine bar screams chic elegance. The 6,000-square-foot open floor plan is decorated with hand-carved blonde wood and antique mirrors, lilac and white crystal chandeliers, and a cascading bubble wall. Skip the cocktails and indulge in their esoteric wine menu, complete with some of the rarest vintages in the world. <em>432 W 41st St, Miami Beach</em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">The Sylvester&nbsp;</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Keep Florida memories alive with a visit to The Sylvester in Midtown. The bar is embellished with warm tones, tropical novelties, and &ldquo;abuela&rsquo;s furniture&rdquo;. The old piano, dim lighting, and nostalgic ambiance is the perfect blend of old and new Miami. Settle into an oversized plush chair and order from their cutting-edge cocktail list. <em>3456 N Miami Ave, Miami</em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">The Dirty Rabbit Wynwood</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This Alice in Wonderland-esque speakeasy will keep you guessing long after you&rsquo;ve ordered a drink. The antique digs, upside-down lamps, and rabbit decor add to the eclectic vibe. Located in the Wynwood neighborhood, The Dirty Rabbit wants guests to enjoy art, freedom of expression, and the &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; of the human mind. If you&rsquo;re looking for a place to chill out, sip on creative cocktails, and listen to old-school music, Dirty Rabbit is the place to be. Try the Death Rider. Customers rave about the cocktail made of Union Mezcal, Ancho Reyes, passion fruit, lime, and homemade tajin salt. <em>151 NW 24th St. Unit 107, Miami</em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Kill Your Idol</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The life-size Bruce Lee statue coming out of the wall may be the focal point of Kill your Idol, but what more could you ask for? The South Beach dive bar is decorated with funky knickknacks and trippy wall murals. The alternative decor matches the vibes at Kill Your Idol. Created as an alternative to the &ldquo;tourism mecca known as South Beach&rdquo;, KYI throws it back to the No Wave movement of the late 70s, focusing on local artists and musicians. <em>222 Espa&ntilde;ola Way, Miami Beach</em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Drunk Bitch</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This South Beach Instagram-worthy lounge specializes in unsuspecting adult frozen beverages. Part Strawberry Daiquiri, part Pi&ntilde;a Colada, the &lsquo;Miami&rsquo; is our favorite. Walk to this bar bedecked in pop art, graffiti, and neon lights in only minutes when you stay with <a href=\"https://www.thecelinohotel.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Celino Hotel</a>. Hungry? Try Bacon Bitch next door. <em>860 Collins Ave, Miami Beach</em></p>\n<p><img id=\"1572973015001\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1572973009/lu6au9jbwyvxhqo0f0xk.jpg\" alt=\"ball-and-chain-bar-miami\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1572973009/lu6au9jbwyvxhqo0f0xk.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1572973009/lu6au9jbwyvxhqo0f0xk.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1572973009/lu6au9jbwyvxhqo0f0xk.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1572973009/lu6au9jbwyvxhqo0f0xk.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1572973009/lu6au9jbwyvxhqo0f0xk.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Ball &amp; Chain</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The historic Little Havana spot once hosted big name jazz musicians like Billie Holiday, Chet Baker, and Louie Armstrong. Originally opened in 1935, <a href=\"https://ballandchainmiami.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ball &amp; Chain</a> serves up craft cocktails, tapas, and live entertainment. After a mojito at the bar outfitted with memorabilia from years past, visit their newly renovated backyard oasis, complete with a pineapple-shaped bandshell. <em>1513 SW 8th St, Miami</em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Los Altos</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Los Altos channels the Prohibition drinking establishments of old with its secret bar on Calle Ocho. Filled with cocktails and sugar skull decor, Los Altos has been described as a &ldquo;sexy Mexican wonderland&rdquo; atop Little Havana&rsquo;s Taquerias el Mexicano. Take the flight of stairs up to the 3,000-square-foot sultry space furnished with repurposed church doors and Catholic relics. Mezcal and tequila-based cocktails are their specialty. Try the Oaxaca al Pastor, Sayulita, and their excellent variety of local craft brews. <em>521 SW 8th St, Miami</em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">RedBar Brickell</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thought-provoking murals adorn the walls of RedBar. Have a seat on one of their comfy couches and take in the visually stimulating place. The neon sign adjacent to the bar says it all, &ldquo;You are exactly where you need to be.&rdquo; The dimly-lit bar is a hodgepodge of mismatched furniture and eclectic decor, complete with a Dracula pinball machine. <em>52 SW 10th St, Miami</em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">The Bar at Dalia</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The sleek indoor-outdoor horseshoe bar is only part of the draw to SoBe&rsquo;s newest <a href=\"https://www.thecelinohotel.com/dine-drink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ultra-chic hangout</a> within the Celino Hotel.
