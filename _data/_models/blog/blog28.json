  "more_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Life in Miami Beach revolves around the water. A stay in this tropical paradise is the perfect time to expand your horizons by diving into an ocean of water sports. From a casual paddleboard jaunt to an exhilarating dive deep beneath the surface, consider trying these water sports during your vacation.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Snorkeling &amp; Diving</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Snorkeling in Miami Beach can be a magical experience. Grab your fins and goggles and dive into the clear blue water for an adventurous&nbsp; snorkel along the shore. Miami is home to the third largest barrier reef in the world. The Florida Reef is in itself a unique ecosystem, teeming with vibrant coral, tropical fish, and bottlenose dolphins. Biscayne National Park and South Pointe Park are both excellent places to start exploring. Only 200 yards southeast of South Beach&rsquo;s 2nd Street lifeguard station is the Jose Cuervo Reef. The concrete bar was sunk on Cinco de Mayo in 2000 to create an artificial reef. At only 10-15 feet below the surface, the reef is a fun place to check out. Grab your rental gear at South Beach Dive and Surf Shop, located only a few blocks from Celino.
